## MySQL

```sql
SELECT category, SUM(sales) total_sales
  FROM book
  JOIN (SELECT book_id, sales
          FROM book_sales
         WHERE sales_date LIKE '2022-01%') book_sales USING(book_id)
 GROUP BY category
 ORDER BY category ASC;

SELECT b.category, SUM(s.sales) total_sales
  FROM book b
  LEFT JOIN book_sales s ON b.book_id = s.book_id
 WHERE MONTH(s.sales_date) = 1
 GROUP BY b.category
 ORDER BY b.category ASC;

SELECT a.category, SUM(b.sales) total_sales
  FROM book a
  JOIN book_sales b ON a.book_id = b.book_id
 WHERE DATE_FORMAT(b.sales_date, '%Y-%m') = '2022-01'
 GROUP BY a.category
 ORDER BY 1 ASC;
```
