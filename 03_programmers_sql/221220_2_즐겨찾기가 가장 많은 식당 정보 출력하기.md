## MySQL

```sql
SELECT food_type, rest_id, rest_name, favorites
  FROM rest_info
 WHERE (food_type, favorites) IN (
     SELECT food_type, MAX(favorites) favorites
       FROM rest_info
      GROUP BY food_type)
 ORDER BY food_type DESC;

SELECT
    FOOD_TYPE,
    REST_ID,
    REST_NAME,
    FAVORITES
FROM
    (SELECT
       FOOD_TYPE,
       REST_ID,
       REST_NAME,
       FAVORITES,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY FOOD_TYPE ORDER BY FAVORITES DESC) AS R
       FROM REST_INFO
    ) AS a
WHERE R = 1
ORDER BY FOOD_TYPE DESC;

SELECT A.FOOD_TYPE, A.REST_ID, A.REST_NAME, A.FAVORITES
  FROM REST_INFO A
  JOIN (SELECT FOOD_TYPE, MAX(FAVORITES) AS FAVORITES
          FROM REST_INFO
         GROUP BY FOOD_TYPE
       ) B
    ON A.FAVORITES = B.FAVORITES AND A.FOOD_TYPE = B.FOOD_TYPE
 ORDER BY FOOD_TYPE DESC
```

## Need to know

- select_type: DERIVED => Inline View랑 같은 의미
- type : ref => 2개 이상의 레코드 탐색함을 의미
- ref : const => 탐색 조건 값으로 상수를 활용함을 의미
